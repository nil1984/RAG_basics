       "  'text': 'in the endocrine system are the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid,  adrenals, thymus, pineal, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. The glands  secrete hormones, which are biological molecules that regulate  cellular processes in other target tissues, so they require  transportation by the circulatory system. Adequate nutrition is  critical for the functioning of all the glands in the endocrine system.  A protein deficiency impairs gonadal-hormone release, preventing  reproduction. Athletic teenage girls with very little body fat often  do not menstruate. Children who are malnourished usually do not  produce enough growth hormone and fail to reach normal height  for their age group. Probably the most popularized connection  between nutrition and the functions of the endocrine system is  that unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to obesity and the  development of Type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) estimates that twenty-six million Americans  have Type 2 diabetes as of 2011. This is 8.3 percent of the US  population. Counties with the highest incidence of obesity also have  the highest incidence of Type 2 diabetes. To see how the rise in  obesity in this country is paralleled by the rise in Type 2 diabetes,  review this report by the CDC.  https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/slides/ maps_diabetesobesity_trends.pdf\\xa0 What is the causal relationship between overnutrition and Type  2 diabetes? The prevailing theory is that the overconsumption of  high-fat and high-sugar foods causes changes in muscle, fat, and  liver cells that leads to a diminished response from the pancreatic  hormone insulin. These cells are called “insulin-resistant.” Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the  blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people  who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular  disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.
