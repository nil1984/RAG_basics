The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology  released a report, which found that women who consume 200  milligrams or more of caffeine a day (which is the amount in 10  ounces of coffee or 25 ounces of tea) increase the risk of  miscarriage7.  Consuming large quantities of caffeine affects the pregnant  mother as well, leading to irritability, anxiety, and insomnia. Most  experts agree that small amounts of caffeine each day are safe  (about one 8-ounce cup of coffee a day or less)8. However, that  amount should not be exceeded.  Foodborne Illness  For both mother and child, foodborne illness can cause major health  problems. For example, the foodborne illness caused by the bacteria  Listeria monocytogenes can cause spontaneous abortion and fetal  or newborn meningitis. According to the CDC, pregnant women  are twenty times more likely to become infected with this disease,  which is known as listeriosis, than nonpregnant, healthy adults.

       "  'text': 'The USDA and the FDA enforce laws regarding the safety of  domestic and imported food. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act of 1938 gives the FDA authority over food  ingredients. The FDA enforces the safety of domestic and imported  foods. It also monitors supplements, food labels, claims that  corporations  make  about  the  benefits  of  products,  and  pharmaceutical  drugs.  Sometimes,  the  FDA  must  recall  contaminated foods and remove them from the market to protect  public health. For example, in 2011 contaminated peanut butter led  to the recall of thousands of jars of a few popular brands.2 Recalls  are almost always voluntary and often are requested by companies  after a problem has been discovered. In rare cases, the FDA will  request a recall. But no matter what triggers the removal of a  product, the FDA’s role is to oversee the strategy and assess the  adequacy and effectiveness of the recall.  Many consumers have concerns about safety practices during the  production and distribution of food. This is especially critical given  recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. For example, during fall  2011 in the United States, there was an eruption of the bacteria  Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupe. It was one of the deadliest  outbreaks in over a decade and resulted in a number of deaths and  hospitalizations.3 In January 2011, the Food Safety Modernization  n+in+the+United+States.
